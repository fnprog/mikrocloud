# Feature Specification: Self-Hosted PaaS Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-self`  
**Created**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a self-hosted paas platform that is ultra secure and ultra configurable that allows devs to deploy their app easily without needing to pay extra for other wrappers. It can be used fully from a cli or with the embedded ui. It allows to deploy individual services (apps) and projects (collection of apps) using podman or docker in the user servers with all the sugar that entails like git based deployment, multi environment with promotion, env vars management, crons, tight networking and security (some service can use gvisor per example), firewall, auto scaling, kubernetes support if you want to add other servers, backups, notifications, multi-user support. IT ships with minimal deps but you can extend it (use more memory/compute) to add stuff like analytics for your projects, per deployment log retention, etc.. .etc... it is extendable. The frontend is written in svelte and is a mix of coolify/vercel/render/sevalla interface. Along with deploying to servers, the app also allow you to deploy to cloud serverless scaling regions. Think GCP, AWS, Azure, it uses their technology to deploy your app in an optimal manner with high availability and co (like vercel/render/sevalla)."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer, I want to deploy my applications to my own infrastructure or cloud platforms through a unified interface, so that I can maintain control over my deployments, reduce vendor lock-in, and save on platform fees while having enterprise-grade features like multi-environment deployments, scaling, and security.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have a Git repository with a web application, **When** I connect the repository to the platform and trigger a deployment, **Then** my application is built, deployed, and accessible with a public URL
2. **Given** I have deployed an application to development environment, **When** I promote it to staging environment, **Then** the exact same build is deployed to staging with environment-specific configuration
3. **Given** I have multiple services in a project, **When** I deploy the project, **Then** all services are deployed with proper networking and can communicate securely
4. **Given** I want to use the platform via CLI, **When** I run commands to create projects and deploy services, **Then** I can manage my entire infrastructure without using the web interface
5. **Given** I have different user roles in my organization, **When** team members access the platform, **Then** they see only the projects and environments they have permission to access
6. **Given** I want to deploy to cloud serverless platforms, **When** I configure cloud deployment targets, **Then** my applications are deployed using cloud-native services with high availability
7. **Given** I have scheduled tasks in my application, **When** I configure cron jobs, **Then** they execute at specified intervals in the deployed environment

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a Git repository becomes unavailable during deployment?
- How does the system handle deployment failures and rollback scenarios?
- What occurs when cloud provider quotas are exceeded?
- How does the platform manage resource conflicts between multiple deployments?
- What happens when container runtime (Docker/Podman) becomes unavailable?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to deploy applications from Git repositories to self-hosted servers
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both Docker and Podman as container runtimes
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a web-based user interface for managing deployments
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for all platform operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple environments (development, staging, production) per project
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow promotion of deployments between environments
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide environment variable management per service and environment
- **FR-008**: System MUST support scheduled tasks (cron jobs) for deployed services
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement role-based access control for multi-user support
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide network isolation and security controls between services
- **FR-011**: System MUST support optional security sandbox (gVisor) for enhanced isolation
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide firewall configuration and management
